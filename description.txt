./myrunner -h for description
./myrunner map to play with the map you chose

IN GAME :
   Space to jump
   Q to quit

THE MAP :
    The map can be as long as you want, each '.' represents an empty space, each 'x' represents a bloc.
    Each line must have the same length.
    When there are not '.' or 'x' anymore, this is the end of the map -> go through the green street lamp to win
                                                                         if you hit a wall before reaching the green street lamp, you lose -> GAME OVER
